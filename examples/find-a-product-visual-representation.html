            <h2>What we <span>design</span></h2>
            <p><img src="images/input-box-part-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
            <p>Typically we design the seach bar inside the Header as two elements: an input box and a button with a magnifier icon</p>
            <p>At this point a decision has to be made regarding the field label and the button hidden text. </p>
            <p><strong>Field label:</strong> which string do we want to use? "Search", "Search for products", "Search for Product & SKU Numbers". Providing a proper label will give users a better idea of the information that can be found using the textbox.</p>
            <p><code>placehoder</code> label are commonly used to label this field, however there's a visual and auditory impact. Read <a href=" https://hecosbornerod.github.io/a11yTOConf2021/examples/find-a-product-input-attributes.html">the placeholder attribute</a> to learn  more.</a></p>
            <p><strong>Button label:</strong> this button has no visible label, <code>aria-label</code> is recommended to be used to give some indication to screen readers about the buton intent.</p>

            <h2>What we might <span>need</span></h2>
            <p>When this search box is developed, a robust component must created. Most likely we'll integrate with a Search API service to display a list of suggestions. This is considered a Combobox.</p>
            <p>A combobox is a widget made up of the combination of two distinct elements: 1) a single-line textbox, and 2) an associated pop-up element for helping users set the value of the textbox.</p>
            <p>The popup is hidden by default, and in Ecommerce typically is displayed when the textbox is focused or when a certain (configurable) number of characters are type.</p>
            <p>Keyboard navigation must be designed and considered during development. For instance using <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>DOWN ARROW</kbd> should focus on the popup (if it's open).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The entire element should be wrapped in a <code>&lt;form></code>.</li>
                <li>The input element should have a clear button when user starts typing.</li>
                <li>The component should show a list of suggestions when user starts typing.</li>
                <li>Aria roles should be used: <code>&lt;combobox></code>, <code>&lt;listbox></code> and <code>&lt;option></code>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What we didn't know we <span>need</span></h2>
            <p><img src="images/input-box-part-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
            <p>Some websites, most commonly appareal use an enhance component that shows more information in the pop-up element. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Top Results: a list of links that relates to the search term</li>
                <li>Categories: a list of recommended categories based on the search term</li>
                <li>Detail list of products: containing images, title, price</li>
                <li>See more results button: will drive the user to the Search result page</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In some cases when the categories are hovered, the list of products changes. Consider how a user with keyboard will navigate this pop-up. Think how a screen reader will navigate this.</p>

            <p>While discussing this component with some of my colleages, here are their comments</p>
            <blockquote>“I can't imagine the data structure, the code, how to communicate this to a screen reader, or how to navigate it with keyboard” </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“This went from 3 points story to a 21 points epic”</blockquote>

            <p>The impact of implementing a solution like this, is that it might require an entire team to build and maintain this component.</p>
