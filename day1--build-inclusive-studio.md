- Over 1 billion people are disabled, you're are already working with someone disabled  
- Ensure captions are on (by default)  
- Appreciate resumes that highlight who the person is and what they have excel at  
- Focus on talents & passion is a game changer (resume)  
- "Contract work is a big risk for  disabled people."  
- Remote work = accessible work. Allows disabled people to manage medical needs and be more productive. 
- Make sure you're networking accessibl.
- Social media, game industry gathering, twitter chats.... most likely are not accessible. 
- Make sure every presentation is accessible.
