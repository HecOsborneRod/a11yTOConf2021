These notes were taken during the #a11yTO Conference in Toronto.  
I apologize if some of them don't make sense, taking notes during a conference is complicated & English is my second language.

If you:

- Want to add more information ...
- or want to add a slide deck ...
- or did you see any typos (there will be many)...
- or do you want to collaborate?

... please reach out to me at [@HecOsborneRod](http://www.twitter.com/HecOsborneRod)

Thanks for the amazing #a11y Community in TO.
