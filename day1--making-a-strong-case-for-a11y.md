- We as stakeholder, manager, designers and developer, need to do better, not only in practicing a11y, but advocating for it as well.
- Practicing a11y in your workflows and methodologies ensures people, disabled or not can access your product.
- Example of wrong a11y: accordion component that shows not scrollable content
- Example of wrong a11y: wront alt text in images
- Buy-in from stakeholders and support from executives is very crucial to practicing accessibility
- Buy-in and support from executives will continuously be successful across the organization.
- Being accessible is a differentiator 
- Design systems should be used not only to ensure branding and consistency, but accessibility, inclusivivity, and understanding of code better.
- Accessibility is a right, not a privilege.
